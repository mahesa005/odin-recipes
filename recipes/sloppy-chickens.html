    <p>Chef John's one-pot chicken recipe gets its irresistibly delicious flavors from cayenne, ketchup, and diced jalapeño peppers. <br> This take on the traditional sloppy Joe is rich, spicy, and totally satisfying.</p>
    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ large yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>¾ cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon hot sauce, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>½ cup diced jalapeño pepper</li>
        <li>4 medium hamburger buns - split, toasted and buttered</li>        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add vegetable oil to a saucepan, and then add (in this order) garlic, yellow onion, brown sugar, kosher salt, black pepper, <br> cayenne, chicken thighs, ketchup, Dijon mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and hot sauce.</li>
        <li>Place over high heat and wait until you can hear the garlic sizzling in the bottom of the pan, about 30 seconds. Let garlic sizzle <br> for about 30 seconds before adding the water. Stir everything together and wait for the mixture to boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken falls apart, about 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Stir in the green onions and peppers and cook until the peppers just turn tender, 3 to 5 minutes more. Taste for seasoning.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and serve on toasted hamburger buns.</li>
    </ol>
